- Money withdrawal
- Transaction consultation
- Exit with card removal

## ATM with state machine
The [second project](https://github.com/DanieleGiorgianni/human-computer-interaction-project/tree/main/atm-state-machine) was to develop an ATM similar to the first, equipped with a state machine with the role of selecting the correct interface to display depending on the interaction phase.<br/>
The interface was developed using the MVC pattern, and the following features were added:
- Pin editing
- Executing bank transaction
